	abstract = {Protein concentrations are set by a complex interplay between
	            gene-specific regulatory processes and systemic factors,
	            including cell volume and shared gene expression machineries.
	            Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and
	            designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively
	            characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect
	            transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli
	            across many conditions. The results revealed two design
	            principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from
	            concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is
	            fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational
	            characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
	            Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily
	            at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates
	            promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth
	            conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation
	            from omics data.},
