	abstract = {Protein concentrations are set by a complex interplay between
	            gene-specific regulatory processes and systemic factors,
	            including cell volume and shared gene expression machineries.
	            Elucidating this interplay is crucial for discerning and
	            designing gene regulatory systems. We quantitatively
	            characterized gene-specific and systemic factors that affect
	            transcription and translation genome-wide for Escherichia coli
	            across many conditions. The results revealed two design
	            principles that make regulation of gene expression insulated from
	            concentrations of shared machineries: RNA polymerase activity is
	            fine-tuned to match translational output, and translational
	            characteristics are similar across most messenger RNAs (mRNAs).
	            Consequently, in bacteria, protein concentration is set primarily
	            at the promoter level. A simple mathematical formula relates
	            promoter activities and protein concentrations across growth
	            conditions, enabling quantitative inference of gene regulation
	            from omics data.},

	abstract = {Accurate measurements of cellular protein concentrations are
	            invaluable to quantitative studies of gene expression and
	            physiology in living cells. Here, we developed a versatile mass
	            spectrometric workflow based on data-independent acquisition
	            proteomics (DIA/SWATH) together with a novel protein inference
	            algorithm (xTop). We used this workflow to accurately quantify
	            absolute protein abundances in Escherichia coli for {$>~$}2,000
	            proteins over {$>~$}60 growth conditions, including nutrient
	            limitations, non-metabolic stresses, and non-planktonic states.
	            The resulting high-quality dataset of protein mass fractions
	            allowed us to characterize proteome responses from a coarse
	            (groups of related proteins) to a fine (individual) protein
	            level. Hereby, a plethora of novel biological findings could be
	            elucidated, including the generic upregulation of low-abundant
	            proteins under various metabolic limitations, the non-specificity
	            of catabolic enzymes upregulated under carbon limitation, the
	            lack of large-scale proteome reallocation under stress compared
	            to nutrient limitations, as well as surprising strain-dependent
	            effects important for biofilm formation. These results present
	            valuable resources for the systems biology community and can be
	            used for future multi-omics studies of gene regulation and
	            metabolic control in E.~coli.},
